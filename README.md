# Bugsnag plugin for Craft CMS
Log Craft errors/exceptions to [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/).

## Installation
You can install Bugsnag via the plugin store, or through Composer.

### Craft Plugin Store
To install **Bugsnag**, navigate to the _Plugin Store_ section of your Craft control panel, search for `Bugsnag`, and click the _Try_ button.

### Composer
You can also add the package to your project using Composer and the command line.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:
```shell
cd /path/to/project
```

2. Then tell Composer to require the plugin, and Craft to install it:
```shell
composer require verbb/bugsnag && php craft plugin/install bugsnag
```

## Configuring Bugsnag
1. Copy the config.php configuration file into your `craft/config` folder as **bugsnag.php**.
2. Update `serverApiKey` with an API key from your Bugsnag project.
3. (Optionally) Set the `releaseStage` configuration setting to something. Defaults to `production`.

If you want to be able to capture early initialization errors, you need to add this plugin to your project's bootstrap configuration. To do this, in `config/app.php`, add the following:

```php
'bootstrap' => [
    '\verbb\bugsnag\Bootstrap',
]
```

### Blacklisting exceptions
If you want to ignore a certain type of exception, like a 404-error, you can do it like this: 

```php
<?php

use yii\web\NotFoundHttpException;

return [
    'blacklist' => [
        [
            'label' => '404 errors etc',
            'class' => function($exception) {
                if ($exception instanceof NotFoundHttpException && $exception->statusCode === 404) {
                    return false;
                }

                return true;
            },
        ],
    ],  
];
```

## Using Bugsnag
It will automatically log most exceptions/errors. If you want to log an exceptions/error from a custom plugin, you may use the service methods:

- For exceptions: `Bugsnag::$plugin->getService()->handleException($exception);`

## Using Bugsnag on the frontend
You can log JavaScript errors on your site, by including the following in your Twig templates:

```twig
{% do view.registerAssetBundle('verbb\\bugsnag\\assetbundles\\frontend\\FrontEndAsset') %}
```

This currently uses v7.0.0 of the Bugsnag library.

You also need to set the `browserApiKey` setting.

If you'd rather include the Bugsnag client in your build and initialize it yourself, there is a helper method to get the browser config based on your plugin settings:

```twig
<script>
    const bugsnagConfig = { ...{{ craft.bugsnag.getBrowserConfig(true) }} }
</script>
```

The method takes one parameter, that toggles if it should return JSON or not.

### Adding metadata from templates
If you want to send custom metadata with your request, you may do something like this:

```twig
{% do craft.bugsnag.metadata({ orderId: cart.id }) %}
```

Note that you have to call these methods before you include the JS bundle.

### Throwing an exception from templates
You can trigger an exception from your templates.

```twig
{% do craft.bugsnag.handleException('Something went terribly wrong.') %}
```
